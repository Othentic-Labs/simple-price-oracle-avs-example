Generate JSON-RPC requests and parse responses in Python.

```sh
pip install jsonrpcclient
```

Generate a request:

```python
from jsonrpcclient import request, parse
req = request("ping")
# => {'jsonrpc': '2.0', 'method': 'ping', 'id': 1}
```

Parse a response:

```python
parsed = parse({"jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": "pong", "id": 1})
# => Ok(result='pong', id=1)
```
For strings, use `request_json` and `parse_json`.
